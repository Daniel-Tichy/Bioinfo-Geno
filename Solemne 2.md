# Classical taxonomy is unable to classify tailed phages further than the family level. 

##  Introduction 
Bacteriophages are the predominant biological entity on the planet, there are more than 10^31 phage particles in the biosphere, 
viral ecologists calculate that its orgins are distant and there are about 10^23 phage infections per second on a global scale,
wich meas that the population is not only large and old but also highly dynamic(1).  
The ongoing sequencing of phage genomes have produced and unprecedented amount of data, which is indispensable for understanding phage 
biology. but despite of these advances, the taxonomic diversity of phages is just beginning to be assessed. 
The International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) recognizes several groups of phages, on the basis of shared morphological 
traits, such as the shape, size, and structure of the virions, with some consideration of other molecular properties.
For example, tailed bacteriophages with double-stranded DNA genomes attain the rank of the order Caudovirales and are divided into 
three main families according to their tail morphology: Siphoviridae (long noncontractile tail), Myoviridae (long contractile tail), 
and Podoviridae (short tail). Within these families, genera are defined by other molecular traits. 
While these families account for more than 60% of Caudovirales, about one-third of all tailed phages remain classified no further 
than the family level(2).
The heart of biological classification is the concept of the species, understood as the smallest group of organisms that can be 
identified robustly.These organisms—through any one of a number of mechanisms—share a common evolutionary fate. 
Importantly, the formation of new lineages of organisms can be equated to the formation of two species from a single ancestral stock.(3)
Today its necesary to divide finely taxonomy for the purpose of understanding bacteriophage biology with the objective of developing 
tools from these. It is clear that placing an organism into a taxonomic “box” has utility only if the box is biologically meaningful. 
In this assay I will argue the infeasibility to classify tailed phages trough a classical (strictly hierarchical) taxonomic 
paradigm further than the family level.
